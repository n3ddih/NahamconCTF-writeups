The warning says that "this page is not **accessible externally**". So the purpose here is to trick the web server thinking that we are accessing it **internally**.

I found an interesting header `X-Forwarded-For`
>A de facto standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.

You can access to this page internally and get the magic ðŸ¤©
