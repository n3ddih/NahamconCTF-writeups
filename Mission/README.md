## Meet The Team
Description:
```
Recover the list of employees working at CONSTELLATIONS.
HINT: "Can we please stop sharing our version control software out on our website?"
```

After inspecting the [list of version control softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software) I saw git. So the `.git` folder might be on the web

Visiting https://constellations.page/.git/ returns a permission denied page

We can use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to expoit it

Firstly, let's use `dumper` module
>This tool can be used to download as much as possible from the found .git repository from webservers which do not have directory listing enabled.

```
$ mper.sh https://constellations.page/.git/ .
```
At this point if you have visited `meet-the-team.html` file, there's a message said that:
>...our team has decided to no longer publicize employee names and info
Does that means it used to be pubicized? ðŸ¤” And I should roll back the previous commit to view its content?

Using `$ git log`
```
commit e7d4663ac6b436f95684c8bfc428cef0d7731455 (HEAD)
Author: Leo Rison <leo.rison@constellations.page>
Date:   Tue Feb 23 19:20:14 2021 -0500

    Management said I need to remove the team details so I redacted that page and added it to robots.txt

commit 4c88ac1c56fe228267cf415c3ef87d7c3b8abd60

commit 1142cc3145fdba8d9eb8f9c9e7ee79bdfda64d9a
Author: Leo Rison <leo.rison@constellations.page>
Date:   Tue Feb 23 18:53:50 2021 -0500

    Added initial assets and landing page
```
The target here is when it first added the *Meet the team page*

Just use `git show`:
```
$ git show 4c88ac1c56fe228267cf415c3ef87d7c3b8abd60
```
Scroll down a little then we can see a list of people with a flag ðŸ˜¸

## Gus

At the end of the website there's a link to Github

There's nothing there but 1 person in people tab, which is the person we are looking for *Gus Rodry*

Just tinkering around with the most recent update repo and you'll get the flag
```
# NOTE:
# This flag submits for the `Gus` challenge you should see after solving `Meet The Team`, after you solve `Bionic`

flag{84d5cc7e162895fa0a5834f1efdd0b32}
```
>Note that there's a *id_rsa* file, which might be used for remote ssh connection in the future

## Hercules

In the *followers* list of Gus there is a person name *HerculesScox*

Tinkering around will give you the flag too ðŸ¤ª
> Note that there's a possible credential:</br>hercules:starstruckherc

## Lyra
