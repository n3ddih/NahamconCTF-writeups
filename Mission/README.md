## Meet The Team
Description:
```
Recover the list of employees working at CONSTELLATIONS.
HINT: "Can we please stop sharing our version control software out on our website?"
```

After inspecting the [list of version control softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software) I saw git. So the `.git` folder might be on the web

Visiting https://constellations.page/.git/ returns a permission denied page

We can use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to expoit it

Firstly, let's use `dumper` module
>This tool can be used to download as much as possible from the found .git repository from webservers which do not have directory listing enabled.

```
$ mper.sh https://constellations.page/.git/ .
```
At this point if you have visited `meet-the-team.html` file, there's a message said that:
>...our team has decided to no longer publicize employee names and info
Does that means it used to be pubicized? ðŸ¤” And I should roll back the previous commit to view its content?

Using `$ git log`

The target here is when it first added the *Meet the team page*

Just use `git show`:
```
$ git show 4c88ac1c56fe228267cf415c3ef87d7c3b8abd60
```
Scroll down a little then we can see a list of people and a flag ðŸ˜¸
